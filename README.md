## functionality
This web app is designed to be used by staff in a hotel enviroment.
It allows the staff to manage the rooms and guests while slos keeping track of what the status is of each room.
when someone approaches the staff they can add them to the system and they can be assigned a room which the system will find based on the amount of people and what kind of room they want. Once the system finds them a room that room is no longer available and they are considered checked in. When they have finished their stay thye system will check them out and assign the room for cleaning. Once the room is clean the staff can make the room available again through the system so it can be assigned to a new guest. the room can also be sent for maintenence if there is a problem which will make that room univailable. once a few guests have been checked out the can all be delted from the system in one go instead of having to manyall delete each person who has checked out.
